# What is an Azure landing zone?

> An Azure landing zone is the output of a multi-subscription Azure environment that accounts for scale, security governance, networking, and identity. An Azure landing zone enables application migration, modernization, and innovation at enterprise-scale in Azure. This approach considers all platform resources that are required to support the customer's application portfolio and doesn't differentiate between infrastructure as a service or platform as a service.
